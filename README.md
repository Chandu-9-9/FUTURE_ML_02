# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction System

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning–based Customer Churn Prediction System** using telecom customer data.  
The objective is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service and provide insights that help businesses improve customer retention.

The model predicts **churn probability per customer** and highlights the key factors contributing to churn.
